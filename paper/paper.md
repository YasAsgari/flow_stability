# Validation and Testing

A comprehensive set of documented case studies has been published to validate the `abn` package (see the `abn` [website](https://r-bayesian-networks.org/)).
The numerical accuracy and quality assurance exercises were demonstrated in @kratzer_additive_2023.
A rigorous testing and linting procedure is implemented based on the `pytest` and `ruff` packages [@pytest8.3,@cite_ruff].
The procedure is tiede to the development and release cycle through continuous integration pipelines thus asserting no untested changes are inserted into the code base.
Additional documentation and resources are available on the `abn` [website](https://r-bayesian-networks.org/) for further reference and guidance.
An extended documentation and further resources (including and automated documentation of the code-base) are available on the 'flowstab` [website](https://flow-stability.readthedocs.io).

# Availability

The source code of `flowstab` is publicly [available on GitHub](https://github.com/alexbovet/flow_stability).
The package can be installed directly from GitHub with `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/alexbovet/flow_stability.git
```
Alternatively, `flowstab` is also available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org).
